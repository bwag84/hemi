I want to generate a progressive web app. It is built to train people with half sided blindness (hemianopsia).

Perform a CSS reset. Use materialize css to make it look nice.


It will have a dividing line of 1px wide in black down the vertical middle of the page.


It will have a box of controls initially set in the top left corner of the screen.

The box will have the controls:

- Choose side to train: left or right
- Depending on the side chosen, move the control box to the opposite side.
- A button the user presses whenever a shape is seen.
- The button is bound to the space bar on the keyboard.
- A field for a score. Number of correct and number of wrong per round.
- An ability to set duration for a single round. Ranging from 20 seconds to 4 minutes.
- Reset after five rounds.

The application will, depending on user input for left or right side, show shapes. It will show at random a triangle, squaure or circle at a random location on the side that is chosen. 

Each shape is shown for 2 seconds by default. 
Add a slider to the control box that allows the user to set the duration.

These shapes will have random colors. Pink, blue or green.
